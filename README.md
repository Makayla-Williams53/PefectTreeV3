# PefectTree

## Project for Advanced Java

This is a project for my high school Advanced Java class in April of 2023. This project was meant to
implement the data structure learned in the previous project(DataStructureV2) in a list view in an
Android Studio App. I chose to do this in a way that allows the user to create and manipulate a Perfect
Binary Tree, through a series of buttons, text areas, and drop down menus.

Requirements:
1) Implementation of a list view
2) Shows overflow in the list view
3) Data structure is included
4) Data structure is declared
5) Data structure is populated
